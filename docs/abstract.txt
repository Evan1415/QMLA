Machine learning protocol for the characterisation of quantum mechanical systems and devices. 

Quantum systems can be approximated by models such as Hamiltonians and Lindbladian operators, 
which can be used to make predictions about the behaviour of those systems over time, as well 
as how the system would interact with others. 
It is difficult, however, to distill the underlying model of a given system, 
due to their delicate nature. 
This software provides a machine learning framework to reverse-engineer quantum systems, 
to find an approximate model which is consistent with the data observed from that system. 
Models are returned in an interpretable, human-readable format, providing insight of the 
interactions to which the system is subject at the quantum mechanical level.
