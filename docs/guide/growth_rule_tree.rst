Growth rule tree
----------------------------
The object which manages a single growth rule. 
Consists of a number of branches. 
Branches are shared with the parent QMLA instance: 
the branch is indexed uniquely by QMLA. i.e. it is possible for the 
branch list of a GR tree to be `[1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]` etc, since QMLA 
is in charge of this.
