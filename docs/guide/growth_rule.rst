Growth Rules
------------


Growth rules are the engine of QMLA. 
They specify how QMLA should proceed at each stage, by determining the 
next set of models to place on the next QMLA branch (which is the same 
object as the next GR tree branch).

The means by which the GR decides the next models is entirely at the
discretion of the user. We detail two growth rules which are used in publications: 
greedy term addition for the study of an electron spin in a nitrogen vacancy centre
and genetic algorithm for generic target systems, with an example Ising lattice.
