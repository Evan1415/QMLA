Introduction
------------

`Quantum Model Learning Agent` is a machine learning protocol for the 
characterisation of quantum mechanical systems and devices. 
It aims to determine the model which best explains observed data
from the system under study. 
It does this by considering a series of candidate models, 
performing a learning procedure to optimise the performance of 
those candidates, and then select the best candidate.
