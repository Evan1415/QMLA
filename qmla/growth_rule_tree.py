        Determine the next set of models, for the next branch of this growth rule tree.

        These are generated iteratively in stages, until that stage is marked as complete within the growth rule.
        * Spwaning: using the set of models from the previous branch to construct new models,
          via :meth:`~qmla.growth_rules.GrowthRule.generate_models`.
        * The spawning stage is terminated when :meth:`~qmla.growth_rules.GrowthRule.check_tree_completed`
          returns True. For example, if a predetermined number of spawn steps have passed,
          or if the model learning has converged.
        * After the spawn stage, the tree enters the pruning stage.
          For example, parental collapse: branch champions of this tree
          are compared with their parents; if either parent or child is strongly superior,
          the loser does not progress to the next branch.
        * Pruning is carried out by :meth:`~qmla.growth_rules.GrowthRule.tree_pruning`, until
          :meth:`~qmla.growth_rules.GrowthRule.check_tree_pruned returns True.
        * After the pruning stage, it must be possible for this tree to nominate a list of
          models to be considered for global champion, by :meth:`~qmla.GrowthRuleTree.nominate_champion`.

        The set of models decided by this method are placed on the next QMLA branch.
        ``pairs_to_compare`` here specifies which pairs of models on that next branch should be compared.
        Typically, model learning corresponds to spawning; during this stage all models on branches
        should be compared.
        Pruning then corresponds to comparing models which have already been leared
        (though new unlearned models will be learned).
