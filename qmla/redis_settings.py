"""
This file provides functionality to create multiple databases on a redis server.
Each QMD has a unique port number (though can share hosts).
By calling databases_from_qmd_id, a set of database addresses unique to that qmd id (host/port) are returned in a dictionary.
These can be used to store information required by distinct actors
to perform QMD, without requiring all information be held on all actors
at all times.
This method is quite slow - useful information is stored in dictionaries and
pickled to redis. Pickling and unpickling is quite slow, so should be minimised.
