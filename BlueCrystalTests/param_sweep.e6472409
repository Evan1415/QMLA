/cm/shared/languages/Anaconda3-5.0.1-PHYS015202/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib/cbook/deprecation.py:106: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: Adding an axes using the same arguments as a previous axes currently reuses the earlier instance.  In a future version, a new instance will always be created and returned.  Meanwhile, this warning can be suppressed, and the future behavior ensured, by passing a unique label to each axes instance.
