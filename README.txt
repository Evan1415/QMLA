HOW IS THE TREE OF THIS FOLDER CONCEIVED


*notebooks in the main folder
ideally the filename at the the end shall have indication of the author to avoid messing around with each other ipy notebooks!
load here notebooks that are "stable" files you would like to share with other collaborators


/Libraries
pay extra care when modifying this, ideally ONLY pull_request/commit it via GitHub, working on a safe local copy folder, unless you are sure changes do not affect retro-compatibility


/testing_notebooks 
folder  ideally suited for quick draft tests for yourself or to address to specific people, here you can upload via Dropbox without dedicating much care, they will eventually be committed to GitHub by someone



HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER
Ideally, Dropbox will be more updated than GitHub, so that the first is to be intended as "nightly" release and GitHub files should be slightly more stable. 

Feel free to clone the repository from GitHub to a local folder of yours, but be aware that you may not work on the most updated version!!!

Ideally work on the Dropbox github folder (NO need to clone in that case) , and pull_request/commit your changes when you are done.
